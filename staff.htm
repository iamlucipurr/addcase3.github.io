			<h3>Staff</h3>
			<p>All of our staff members hold Wilderness First Responder certifications and have completed courses with the American Mountain Guide Association (AMGA). While the training and certifications of our staff are nice, what we really take pride in at Cliff Hangers is the quality of our instructors. Many climbing schools will guide clients up cliffs but at Cliff Hangers we put an emphasis on teaching you the skills you need to enjoy this sport safely on your own without constant professional guiding. To ensure our staff is able to do this, we hire only instructors who have a love of teaching as well as a love for climbing.</p>
